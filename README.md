# data-to-plate-layout
A script to convert plate reader data from so called narrow format to a matrix corresponding to the plate layout. Many readers store and output data using an Entity–attribute–value model, which is nice for analysis, but sometimes you want to see the values in the same layout as the actual plate, for example to estiamte if there are "area effects".
